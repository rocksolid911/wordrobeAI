FLUTTER PROVIDER TO BLOC/CUBIT MIGRATION - QUICK SUMMARY
=========================================================

PROJECT OVERVIEW:
- App: Digital Wardrobe & Smart Outfit Stylist
- Current: 4 Providers (1,118 lines), 11 Screens with Provider usage
- Models: 6 fully Equatable-compliant models
- Services: 6 service layer classes (unchanged in migration)

PROVIDERS IDENTIFIED:
1. AuthProvider (219 lines)
   - Used by: 7 screens
   - Complexity: LOW
   - Focus: Email/Google auth, profile management, onboarding

2. WardrobeProvider (305 lines)
   - Used by: 3 screens
   - Complexity: MEDIUM
   - Focus: CRUD clothing items, filtering, searching, statistics

3. OutfitProvider (240 lines)
   - Used by: 0 screens (stub implementation)
   - Complexity: MEDIUM
   - Focus: CRUD outfits, scheduling, calendar integration

4. RecommendationProvider (354 lines)
   - Used by: 1 screen + home
   - Complexity: HIGH
   - Focus: AI recommendations, weather, shopping suggestions

MIGRATION SCOPE:
- Files to create: 4 directories (Auth, Wardrobe, Outfit, Recommendation)
- Files to modify: 12 files (main.dart + 11 screens)
- Files to keep: All models, services, core
- Lines to refactor: ~2,300 lines total

MIGRATION TIMELINE:
- AuthCubit: 2 hours
- WardrobeCubit: 4 hours
- OutfitCubit: 3-4 hours
- RecommendationBloc: 5-6 hours
- Screen Refactoring: 6-8 hours
- Testing: 4-6 hours
- TOTAL: 24-31 hours (~3-4 days)

KEY PATTERNS TO MIGRATE:
1. Provider.of() → BlocBuilder for UI listeners
2. Provider.of(..., listen: false) → context.read<Cubit>()
3. MultiProvider → MultiBlocProvider
4. notifyListeners() → emit(newState)
5. Getters for computed values → methods or cached states

CURRENT DEPENDENCIES:
- provider: ^6.1.1

NEW DEPENDENCIES NEEDED:
- flutter_bloc: ^8.1.0
- bloc: ^8.1.0

RISK ASSESSMENT:
- Overall Risk: LOW
- Codebase is well-organized
- Clear separation of concerns
- No deeply nested provider dependencies
- Models are already migration-ready

RECOMMENDED ORDER:
1. AuthCubit (foundation)
2. WardrobeCubit (core feature)
3. RecommendationBloc (complex logic)
4. OutfitCubit (less critical)
5. Comprehensive testing

NEXT STEPS:
1. Add flutter_bloc dependencies to pubspec.yaml
2. Create lib/bloc/ folder structure
3. Start with AuthCubit implementation
4. Update main.dart with MultiBlocProvider
5. Refactor screens incrementally, testing each one
